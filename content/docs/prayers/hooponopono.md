Hold the breath for 7 counts.

Exhale for 7 counts.

Hold the breath for 7 counts.

This is considered one round, do 9 rounds.

# Opening Prayer

“I” Am The “I”
“I” come forth from the void into light,

I am the breath that nurtures life,

I am that emptiness, that hollowness beyond all consciousness,
The I, the Id, the All.

I draw my bow of rainbows across the waters,
The continuum of minds with matters.

I am the incoming and outgoing of breath,
The invisible, untouchable breeze,

The undefinable atom of creation.

I am the I.

# Morrnah’s Prayer (4 times)

**Spirit, superconscious,**

Please locate the origin of my feelings, thoughts of all fear, doubt, anxiety, and resistance to a blissful married life with a beautiful, young, and loving partner, and a life of abundance and prosperity.

Take each and every level, layer, area, and aspect of my being to this origin. Analyze it and resolve it perfectly with God's truth.

Come through all generations of time and eternity. Healing every incident and its appendages based on the origin.

Please do it according to God's will until I am at the present, filled with light and truth.

God's peace and love, forgiveness of myself for my incorrect perceptions. Forgiveness of every person, place, circumstances and events which contributed to this, 1 these feelings and thoughts. 2

# REPENTANCE PRAYER

DIVINE CREATOR, Father, Mother, Child as ONE:

Let this cleanse purify release, sever, and cut all the negative memories, blocks, energies, and vibrations and transmute these unwanted energies into PURE LIGHT........And it is done


# CLOSING PRAYER - THE PEACE OF “I”

THE PEACE OF “I”

Peace be with you, All my peace,

The peace that is “I”, the Peace that is “I” am,
The peace for always, now and forever and evermore,
My peace “I” give to you, My Peace “I” leave with you,
Not the world’s peace, but, only my Peace,

The Peace of “I"
